Stream Analytics supports a simple, declarative query model for describing transformations. 
In order to optimize for ease of use, Stream Analytics uses a SQL variant, and removes the need for customers to deal with the 
technical complexities of stream processing systems. Using the Stream Analytics query language in the in browser query editor, 
you get intelli-sense auto-complete to help you can quickly and easily implement time series queries, including temporal-based joins, 
windowed aggregates, temporal filters, and other common operations such as joins, aggregates, projections, and filters. 
In addition, in-browser query testing against a sample data file enables quick, iterative development.
